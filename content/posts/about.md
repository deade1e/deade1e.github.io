### Ciao!

<div style="float: left"><img src="/images/me.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" style="width: 150px; margin: 15px"></div>

I am **Francesco**, an independent **cybersecurity researcher** and **developer** with a deep love for the world of information technology.
My journey began when I was just three years old, discovering the classic video game Prince of Persia on MS-DOS.
From there, my fascination with computers grew, and I began to learn programming, starting with my favorite language, **C**.

My expertise and interests lie in **intelligence collection and analysis**, **distributed systems**, and **malware**.
I strongly believe in **open-source software** and have made contributions to the community.
My work experience has given me a solid understanding of identifying **application vulnerabilities**, performing **penetration testing** 
and collecting and analyzing data to **prevent intrusions** for both businesses and government organizations.

I approach my work with dedication and perseverance, always putting in maximum effort to pursue what I believe is right.
Currently, I am the **Head of Threat Intelligence** for a company in Turin, Italy.
In this role, I lead a team to collect and analyze data on emerging cybersecurity threats, using it to proactively defend our customers and their assets.

I am proud of my journey in the world of information technology, and I am dedicated to making a lasting impact in the field of cybersecurity, and 
therefore I hope you'll **enjoy** what you'll read here!
